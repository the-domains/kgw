There’s little agreement surrounding possible solutions to such problems, and there’s no way to verify if a proposed fix will work or if one that’s been tried has worked. These are called “wicked problems”because you cannot simply engineer a solution to them. Fortunately, methods do exist to manage them—if not to solve these messes, to at least improve them. One such approach is called <b>Structured Dialogic Design</b>, which was developed by the Institute for 21st Century Agoras, primarily by cyberneticist Alexander Christakis. SDD builds upon decades of research into small-group interactions to provide a process whereby people with radically different, even hostile agendas can sit down together and agree upon mutually beneficial plans of action. An introduction to the process can be found in the book The Talking Point, by Thomas R. Flanagan and Alexander N. Christakis. Decision Architecture There will be no “Facebook for politics,”no single solution to the problem of human governance, because politics is a wicked problem. That doesn’t mean we can’t improve political processes at all levels, perhaps dramatically, by solving many smaller subissues using communications technologies, cognitive bias filtering software, decision-making strategies, and so on. SDD is just one example of how to do this. The story “Degrees of Freedom”showcases a possible set of such improvements, just a tiny subset of the many possibilities. I’ve included more information about some of these below. </p>"},{"block":{"id":"c86992ff-3211-4d65-9e79-56f5dd496266","item":"7a1c333b-793e-46e2-ba61-7903d90f968a","type":"text","html":"<p>Humans are hardwired to detect extremely subtle differences in facial expression.
