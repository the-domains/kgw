In 1973, Herman Chernoff suggested using this capability to make complex multivariant data more easily visible to analysts. Different parameters of a complex data set are mapped to different features on these “Chernoff faces,”making it easy for viewers to perceive small differences between sets. Extending this idea, Dorians are pictures of yourself that are more or less happy, healthy, or fit depending on how your current behaviors or habits are trending. Basically, they show you your future self as you might look if you keep doing what you’re doing. Dorians are a natural and intuitive interface for “quantified Self”apps such as sports and fitness trackers, though in this story they also interpret the results of more significant life choices. You can think of the augmented reality app Nexcity mentioned in the story as a form of urban Dorian (see SimCanada, opposite). </p>"},{"block":{"id":"a77fdce5-4571-4acc-9f3c-3c458b46f349","item":"7a1c333b-793e-46e2-ba61-7903d90f968a","type":"text","html":"<p>Liaisons are a concept I developed for a Canadian military foresight project in 2009.
