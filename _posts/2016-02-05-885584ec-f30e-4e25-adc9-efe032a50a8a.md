title: No Computation Without Representation.
description: >-
  All this gets back to a bigger trend we see these days: closed platforms are
  like governments (google, apple, github, twitter). We don't allow (sane,
  first-world) governments to exist without citizen representation. We must
  demand user-level representation in corporations running global scale closed
  platforms everybody relies on. Community powered social platforms don't exist
  without the community, and private corporations exercising extended "we don't
  give a crap about the users even though we have millions (or hundreds of
  millions) of them" patterns must be... corrected.

# No Computation Without Representation.

All this gets back to a bigger trend we see these days: closed platforms are like governments (google, apple, github, twitter). We don't allow (sane, first-world) governments to exist without citizen representation. We must demand user-level representation in corporations running global scale closed platforms everybody relies on. Community powered social platforms don't exist without the community, and private corporations exercising extended "we don't give a crap about the users even though we have millions (or hundreds of millions) of them" patterns must be... corrected.

<article style=""><h1>GitHub is apparently in crisis again | Hacker News</h1><p>GitHub raised $250 million last year and, as you mentioned, there's nothing externally visible to show for it (as consumers of their public platform). (random guess: the $250 million could have been $150-$200 million in cashing out stock to individuals (like crooked groupon shenanigans) then maybe $50 million for operations?</p></article>
