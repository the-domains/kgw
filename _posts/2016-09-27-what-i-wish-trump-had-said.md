# What I wish Trump had said

Climate change, not terrorism, is the only imminent threat to our continued existence. I propose that we do a little national restructuring.

Missions to Mars are a great dream to reach for, but we need a plan to survive here, because it's the only viable choice we have for centuries.

I propose that we form a new Planetary Survival Administration (**PSA**).

PSA will be budgeted by a **%** designation on your taxes. All other agencies will have to make their case for the rest. Or crowdfund.

We'll figure out more forms of more-direct democratic decision-making. [Code for America][0] and [18f.gsa.gov][1] have some ideas I'm sure.

Basic income for all, with bonuses for people working on PSA-associated projects.

All projects must answer the fundamental **Earth User Story**: how does this help our health, happiness, and chances of survival? We have to optimize our economy to reward for that. I don't think it's that complicated. I know money.

You speak of trickle-down economy... the only times that has worked is the trickle out of knowledge, and eventual creation of whole segments of the economy, from big projects, NASA and Defense. Think big.

To our seniors in high school, we're going to **bring back the draft**, but it will be more like AmeriCorp: a gap-year program that you can spend teaching, doing medical service, working for a non-profit, joining a PSA-funded startup... get a living wage and funding for continuing education.

And by the way, we're gonna make a show about it. Gonna be magnificent. So great. I'll be hosting it, pretending to call the shots. Not to be pinocchious, but it will be a truly beautiful thing.
