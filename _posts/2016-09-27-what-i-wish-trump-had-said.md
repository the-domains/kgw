# What I wish Trump had said

Climate change, not terrorism, is the only imminent threat to our continued existence. I propose that we do a little national restructuring.

Missions to Mars are a great dream to reach for, but we need a plan to survive here, because it's the only viable choice we have for centuries.

I propose that we form a new Planetary Survival Administration (**PSA**).

PSA will be budgeted by a **%** designation on your taxes. All other agencies will have to make their case for the rest. Or crowdfund.

We'll figure out some form of democratic decision-making.

Basic income for all, with bonuses for people working on PSA-associated projects.

All projects must answer the fundamental **Earth User Story**: how does this help our chances of survival? We have to optimize our economy to reward for that. I don't think it's that complicated. I know money.

To our seniors in high school, we're going to bring back the draft, but it will be more like AmeriCorp: a gap-year program that you can spend teaching, doing medical service, working for a non-profit, joining a PSA-funded startup... get a living wage and funding for continuing education.

And by the way, we're gonna make a show about it. Gonna be magnificent. So great. I'll be hosting it, pretending to call the shots. Not to be pinocchious, but it will be a truly beautiful thing.
