## Platform for Participatory Politics --- We The People âˆž.0

How can I feel more connected to the political process?

I'm imagining a platform to connect you with a council of 51 neighbors. You meet to discuss issues that affect your area, and also elect one person to represent your neighborhood at the next council level.

Thanks to the powers of exponents, we only need 5 levels to represent everybody in the USA (51^5). (Finland would only need 4.)

I could **convince my neighbors** to help me deal with cutting the grass at the corner to improve visibility.

I _also_ think I could convince them to **ratify** a well-designed infographic about how healthcare should be structured.

The late Aaron Swartz wrote about the idea here: [http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/parpolity][0]

\> There is something rather old-fashioned about this notion of sitting down with one's fellow citizens and rationally discussing the issues of the day. But there is also something exciting and new about it. In the same way that blogs have given everyone a chance to be a publisher, Wikipedia lets everyone be an encyclopedia author, and YouTube lets anyone be a television producer, Parpolity would let everyone be a politician.

\> The Internet has shown us that the pool of people with talent far outnumbers the few with the background, connections, and wealth to get to a place in society where they can practice their talents professionally. (It also shows us that many people with those connections aren't particularly talented.)

(Making this visualization this morning is my way of coping. I think conditions are ripe to build this platform, so... what are the next steps?)
