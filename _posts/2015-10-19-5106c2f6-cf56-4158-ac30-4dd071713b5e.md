# Birth of Thanaticism

\> But depression is a subsidiary aspect of thanaticism. You are supposed to be depressed, and you are supposed to think that's your individual failing or problem. Your bright illusory fantasy-world is ripped away from you, and the thanatic reality is bared -- you are supposed to think its your fault. You have failed to believe. See a shrink. Take some drugs. Do some retail therapy.

<article style=""><h1>Birth of Thanaticism</h1><p>I don't know why we still call it capitalism. It seems to be some sort of failure or blockage of the poetic function of critical thought. Even its adherents have no problem calling it capitalism any more. Its critics seem to be reduced to adding modifiers to it: postfordist, neoliberal, or the rather charmingly optimistic 'late' capitalism.</p></article>
