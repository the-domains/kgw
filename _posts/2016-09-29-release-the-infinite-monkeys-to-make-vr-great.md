<article style=""><img src="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ap2409_thompson-main-1200x630-e1474663170781.jpg" /><h1>Release the Infinite Monkeys to Make VR Great</h1><p>I have zero virtual-reality skills. I don't know how to work in Unity, the graphics software engine often used to make immersive worlds. I have little sense for 3-D design. But I have a secret weapon: A-Frame, an easy-to-use language released by Mozilla last winter.</p></article>
