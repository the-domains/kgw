description: >-
  Play House is an automata that generates slow hypnotic acid house through
  mechanisms built from LEGO Technic. This piece was made for AudioGraft 2014
  with a commission from Oxford Contemporary Music. Thanks to Danny Chapman and
  Gareth Ardron for cameras, and Vic Bosher & the OCM team for support!
