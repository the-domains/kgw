  RoboActionPainting series by Dragan Ilić features abstracted mark-making using
  an industrial robot, sometimes carrying and guiding the artist himself: The
  artist constantly transposes into the third dimension his decade's
  long-running conceptual practice based on the usage of pencils as the basic
  draftsman's tool, starting primarily with the media of performance art,
  installation and sculpture in extended field.
