title: Machine with Concrete â€” Arthur Ganson
publisher: {}
description: >-
  Legendary kinetic and mechanical sculptor Arthur Ganson has lent us one of his
  simplest and most potent works. A motor is connected to a block of concrete
  via a simple system of gears. The final gear, embedded in concrete, is set up
  to make one revolution once every 13.7 billion years, yet the machine whirs
  uninterrupted.
